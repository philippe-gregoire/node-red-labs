Seven new apps exploring the capabilities of Watson Developer Cloud in Node-RED.
Each kit comes with a video introduction, which shows each application in use.

To make use of the starter kit applications, you will need some extra node-RED nodes. The easiest way
to get them is to start from our [custom boilerplate starter](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-red-bluemix-starter)

Otherwise add the following to your package.json, to pull in the extra nodes.
````
    "node-red-contrib-browser-utils":"0.x",
    "node-red-contrib-media-utils":"0.x",
    "node-red-contrib-play-audio": "2.0.x",
    "node-red-dashboard": "2.0.x",
````
